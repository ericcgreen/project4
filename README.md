## About App
This application allows users to post articles and to rate them based on that article's honesty. The honesty of an article is rated on a scale of 1 (False) to 5 (Honest) and corresponding colors. This application drew inspiration from Politifact.com and FactChecker.org. The name of this app was inspired by Henry David Thoreau's famous quote: "Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth."

## Technologies Used
The front end of this app was developed using AngularJS. The back end of this app was developed using MongoDB and Express. NodeJS was used to install the necessary packages to make this app functional.

## Approach Taken
My approach consisted of developing and ensuring CRUD functionality for all my models in both the front and back ends. Once achieved, my goal was then to develop a user friendly app with a minimalist aesthetic and an easy to understand color code.

I first wrote out my ERDs to develop my models and what was required in them and then used wireframes to draw the concept of my app.

## User Stories
As a user I should be able to understand the concept of the app and how to use it.
As a user I should be able to see the key to understand the rating system and the colors.
As a user I should be able to create, read, update, and delete a post.
As a user I should be able to go to the article that's linked.

## Improvements Needed
I would like to add a second model of comments so that other users can interact more with the articles and have thoughtful discussions. I would like to incorporate a Twitter timeline feed that returned tweets of a hashtag searched instead of a specifc news organization like what I have now. I would like to include user authentication. I would like to figure out how to embed or import full or screenshots of articles. I would like to figure out how ti get rid of the "#" in the URL.
